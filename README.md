# SudokuSolver
A python implementation of Donald Kunth's Algorithm X to sudoks very efficiently 

This is an implementation of Algorithm X to solve sudokus using dancing links in python, although I hope the code is well commented I would suggest you have a good understanding of Algorithm X, Dancing Links and Exact Cover problems before going through the code, here are some links that may be useful.
